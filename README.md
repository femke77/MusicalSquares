# MusicalSquares

WINNER of the game!!!
This is project for Embedded apps. It corresponds to a robot I built with the Mindstorm set. This language is Lejos.
The robot starts moving when it hears the music. It then proceeds to try to find an annulus on the floor. If it bumps into the floor frame it will 
back up and try again in a different direction. When it finds the white spot in the middle of the annulus it shuts down so as to not resume any movement
thanks to butting from other robots.
