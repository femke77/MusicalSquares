WINNER of the game!!!
This is project for Embedded Apps. It corresponds to a robot I built with the Mindstorm set. This language is Lejos, which is really Java with a weird name.
The robot starts moving when it hears the music. It then proceeds to try to find an annulus on the floor. If it bumps into the wall of the frame it will back up and try again in a different direction. When it finds the white spot in the middle of the annulus it shuts down so as to not resume any movement thanks to butting from other robots. 
This was designed by me and coded by me and I WON!!!!

early version (mostly done but missing a couple sensors)
